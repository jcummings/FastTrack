# üìú Microsoft Teams Recurring Meeting Report

This PowerShell script scans user calendars in a Microsoft 365 tenant to find and report on all recurring Teams meetings. It can run against **all users** in the tenant or a **targeted list of users** from a CSV file. It exports key details to a CSV file, including the organizer, meeting subject, participant count, and a list of invited participants.

The script uses the Microsoft Graph API with **Application permissions**, ensuring it can run securely as an authorized background process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è One-Time Setup: Create an App Registration

The script authenticates using an App Registration in Microsoft Entra ID. This is a one-time setup that allows the script to run with its own permissions, granted by an administrator.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the App Registration

1.  Navigate to the **[Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com)**.
2.  Go to **Identity** \> **Applications** \> **App registrations**.
3.  Click **+ New registration**.
4.  Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `Teams Meeting Report Script`).
5.  Leave the other settings as default and click **Register**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Grant API Permissions

1.  In your new App Registration, go to the **API permissions** blade.
2.  Click **+ Add a permission**, then select **Microsoft Graph**.
3.  Select **Application permissions**.
4.  Search for and check the boxes next to the following two permissions:
      * `Calendars.Read`
      * `User.Read.All`
5.  Click **Add permissions**.
6.  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Click the **Grant admin consent for [Your Tenant]** button to approve the permissions. The status for both should change to a green checkmark.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Client Secret

1.  Go to the **Certificates & secrets** blade.
2.  Click **+ New client secret**.
3.  Add a description and choose an expiration period.
4.  Click **Add**.
5.  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Immediately copy the secret's "Value"** and save it somewhere secure (like a password manager). You will not be able to see it again after you leave this page.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Script

1.  Save the script to your computer with a `.ps1` extension (e.g., `Get-RecurringTeamsMeetings.ps1`).
2.  Open a PowerShell terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
3.  Choose one of the following methods to run the script. You will be prompted for your Tenant ID, App ID, and Client Secret.

### Method 1: Scan ALL Users

To run the script against every user in your tenant, execute it without any parameters:

```powershell
.\Get-RecurringTeamsMeetings.ps1
```

### Method 2: Scan Specific Users from a CSV File

To target only specific users, use the `-UserCsvPath` parameter.

**1. Create your CSV file:** The file must contain a header row with the column name `UserPrincipalName`.
Example `users.csv` file:

```csv
UserPrincipalName
adele.vance@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
alex.wilber@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
diego.siciliani@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
```

**2. Run the script with the parameter:**

```powershell
.\Get-RecurringTeamsMeetings.ps1 -UserCsvPath "C:\path\to\your\users.csv"
```

-----

## üìÑ Output

The script generates a CSV file named `RecurringMeetingsReport.csv` in the same directory where the script is located. The report contains the following columns:

  * **Organizer**: The user principal name of the meeting's creator.
  * **MeetingSubject**: The subject or title of the meeting.
  * **RecurrencePattern**: A description of how often the meeting occurs.
  * **ParticipantCount**: The total number of invitees.
  * **InvitedParticipants**: A semicolon-separated list of invitee email addresses.
  * **CreatedDateTime**: The timestamp when the recurring meeting series was first created.
