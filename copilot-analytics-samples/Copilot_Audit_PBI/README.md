> [!NOTE] 
> New Version! This version includes agent details including columns to categorize interactions that are related to SPO Agent, Custom Agent, and Copilot Pages (powered by Loop), including Copilot Studio lite & full agents.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
- Exchange Online Management module
- Admin permissions for Microsoft Graph and Exchange Online
- Microsoft 365 E5 license or Microsoft 365 Copilot license
- Power BI Desktop (for opening and customizing the template)

## üöÄ Installation

### Required PowerShell Modules
The script will check for the required modules and offer to install them if they're missing:
- Microsoft.Graph
- ExchangeOnlineManagement

If you prefer to install manually, run:

Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Force -AllowClobber

## üîß Usage

### Running the PowerShell Script
1. Download the script file `Export-M365CopilotReports.ps1`
2. Open PowerShell as an administrator
3. Navigate to the script location
4. Run the script:

   .\Export-M365CopilotReports.ps1

5. The script will display a menu with the following options:
   - Export Entra Users Details
   - Export Purview Audit Logs (Copilot Interactions Only)
   - Export Microsoft 365 Copilot Usage Reports
   - Exit

### Data Export Options

#### üë• Export Entra Users Details
This option exports user information from Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), including:
- User profile details (DisplayName, Email, Department, etc.)
- Manager information (critical for organizational hierarchy in reports)
- License information (to identify Copilot-licensed users)

The exported CSV file will be used as input for the Power BI dashboard to build organizational context.

#### üìù Export Copilot Audit Logs
This option extracts Copilot interaction data from Microsoft Purview audit logs:
- User activity with Copilot across different applications
- Copilot prompts and responses (where available)
- Context of Copilot usage (documents, chats, etc.)
- Resources accessed by Copilot
- Identification of SPO Agent, Custom Agent, and Copilot Pages interactions

You can specify the number of days to look back (default is 7 days).

#### üìà Export Microsoft 365 Copilot Usage Reports
This option retrieves aggregated Copilot usage data at the user level:
- User activity dates across different applications
- Last activity timestamps by application

You can choose from different time periods:
- D7 (7 days)
- D30 (30 days) - default
- D90 (90 days)
- D180 (180 days)

### Setting Up the Power BI Dashboard
1. Open the Power BI File (`.pbix` file)
2. This will open the dashboard with sample data. 
3. To load your reports, **Click Home > Transform Data** and update the parameters to point to your Entra Users CSV Export and Copilot Audit Activities CSV Export.

4. Click **Close & Apply** and Power BI will load the dashboard with your reports. 

## üìä Dashboard Features
The Copilot Analytics Dashboard provides visualizations including:
- User adoption and activity metrics
- Department-level usage patterns
- Application-specific Copilot usage
- Activity timelines and trends
- Resource access patterns
- SPO Agent, Custom Agent, and Copilot Pages usage analytics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure you have appropriate admin permissions
- **Missing Data**: Verify audit logging is enabled in Microsoft Purview
- **Performance Issues**: For large organizations, consider reducing the data export timeframe
- **Module Loading Errors**: Try reinstalling the required PowerShell modules

### Logging
The script creates detailed log files in the output directory. Review these for troubleshooting:
- Each export function creates its own log file with timestamp
- Logs contain detailed information about connection attempts and data retrieval
