## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
- Exchange Online Management module
- Admin permissions for Microsoft Graph and Exchange Online
- Microsoft 365 E5 license or Microsoft 365 Copilot license
- Power BI Desktop (for opening and customizing the template)

## üöÄ Installation

### Required PowerShell Modules
The script will check for the required modules and offer to install them if they're missing:
- Microsoft.Graph
- ExchangeOnlineManagement

If you prefer to install manually, run:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Force -AllowClobber
```

## üîß Usage

### Running the PowerShell Script
1. Download the script file `Export-M365CopilotReports.ps1`
2. Open PowerShell as an administrator
3. Navigate to the script location
4. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   .\Export-M365CopilotReports.ps1
   ```

5. The script will display a menu with the following options:
   - Export Entra Users Details
   - Export Purview Audit Logs (Copilot Interactions Only)
   - Export Microsoft 365 Copilot Usage Reports
   - Exit

### Data Export Options

#### üë• Export Entra Users Details
This option exports user information from Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), including:
- User profile details (DisplayName, Email, Department, etc.)
- Manager information (critical for organizational hierarchy in reports)
- License information (to identify Copilot-licensed users)

The exported CSV file will be used as input for the Power BI dashboard to build organizational context.

#### üìù Export Copilot Audit Logs
This option extracts Copilot interaction data from Microsoft Purview audit logs:
- User activity with Copilot across different applications
- Copilot prompts and responses (where available)
- Context of Copilot usage (documents, chats, etc.)
- Resources accessed by Copilot
- Identification of SPO Agent, Custom Agent, and Copilot Pages interactions

You can specify the number of days to look back (default is 7 days).

#### üìà Export Microsoft 365 Copilot Usage Reports
This option retrieves aggregated Copilot usage data at the user level:
- User activity dates across different applications
- Last activity timestamps by application

You can choose from different time periods:
- D7 (7 days)
- D30 (30 days) - default
- D90 (90 days)
- D180 (180 days)

### Setting Up the Power BI Dashboard
1. Open the Power BI File (`.pbix` file)
2. This will open the dashboard with sample data. 
3. To load your reports, **Click Home > Transform Data** and update the parameters to point to your Entra Users CSV Export and Copilot Audit Activities CSV Export.

- User adoption and activity metrics
- Department-level usage patterns
- Application-specific Copilot usage
- Activity timelines and trends
- Resource access patterns
- Agent activity including Copilot Studio full & lite agents, SPO Agents, 1P Agents (Researcher, Analyst, Employee Self Service)

## üéØ Key Questions & Insights

This dashboard is designed to help answer questions about Copilot usage across your organization:

### üë§ User & Adoption Analytics
- **Who are your top Copilot users?** - Identify power users and champions who can help drive adoption
- **Which users have Copilot licenses but aren't using it?** - Compare usage between M365 Copilot licensed vs unlicensed users to optimize license allocation
- **What is the user activity breakdown?** - Categorize users by engagement level:
  - **(0-10 Days) Very Active** - Recently engaged users
  - **(10-30 Days) Active** - Regular users
  - **(30-60 Days) Moderately Active** - Occasional users
  - **(60-90 Days) Somewhat Inactive** - At-risk users who may need training
  - **(90+ Days) Inactive** - Candidates for license reallocation
  - **Never Used** - Identify users who need onboarding support

### üè¢ Organizational Insights
- **Which departments are leading in Copilot adoption?** - Understand organizational adoption patterns and identify departments that may need additional support
- **How active are users within each department?** - Drill down from department-level metrics to individual user activity for targeted enablement
- **What is the usage breakdown by manager?** - Leverage organizational hierarchy to identify management areas with high or low adoption
- **How does usage vary by region?** - Track geographic adoption trends for global organizations

### ü§ñ Agent & Application Analytics
- **Which Copilot agents are most popular?** - Identify top-performing SPO Agents, Custom Agents, and Copilot Pages (powered by Loop)
- **What are the top M365 applications where Copilot is being used?** - Understand which productivity apps (Teams, Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.) see the highest Copilot engagement
- **How has Copilot usage evolved over time?** - Track adoption trends and identify patterns in Copilot and agent usage across different time periods

### üìà Strategic Planning
- **Where should we focus enablement efforts?** - Use activity and license data to prioritize training and change management initiatives
- **Are we maximizing our Copilot investment?** - Analyze license utilization and ROI by identifying unused licenses and low-engagement users
- **Which teams or roles benefit most from Copilot?** - Identify high-value use cases and success patterns to replicate across the organization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure you have appropriate admin permissions
- **Missing Data**: Verify audit logging is enabled in Microsoft Purview
- **Performance Issues**: For large organizations, consider reducing the data export timeframe
- **Module Loading Errors**: Try reinstalling the required PowerShell modules

### Logging
The script creates detailed log files in the output directory. Review these for troubleshooting:
- Each export function creates its own log file with timestamp
- Logs contain detailed information about connection attempts and data retrieval
